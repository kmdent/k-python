For python 2, we decided to revamp our whole design. Our scope was not equiped to deal with the global and nonlocal keywords. We fixed this. Scoping seems to be working properly. We also changed our model so that everything is an object. This is working pretty well. We drew from design 5 for the scoping, and from design 1 for the object system. We thought that design 1 was throwing away information about the type of the object, so we changed it, and it works well. The ground we are working on is strong like wood. Adding exceptions will be easy, as well as adding new types with the object structure.
